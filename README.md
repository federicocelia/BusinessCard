#Business Card Project

##📌 Overview

This project is a custom digital business card built using HTML and CSS. It displays a profile image, name, role, and contact details while experimenting with layout, color palettes, hover effects, and animations. The goal is to practice front‑end fundamentals and explore creative UI styling.

##✨ Features

##🎨 Custom Color Palette

The design uses a personalized palette inspired by Coolors, including:

Soft blue base background

Deep navy accents

Purple highlight color on hover

This creates a clean, modern aesthetic.

##🖼️ Styled Avatar

The profile image includes:

Rounded corners

A solid border

A hover effect that changes the border to goldenrod

This adds personality and interactivity.

##💳 Card Layout

The card includes:

Centered layout

Flexbox alignment

Rounded corners

A bold bottom border

Everything is arranged for clarity and balance.

##🎬 Sliding Background Hover Animation

The card features a custom animation where a darker background color slides in from the left when hovered. When the mouse leaves, the background slides back out, returning to the original color.

This effect is created using a ::before pseudo‑element layered behind the card content.

##🖌️ Smooth Color Transitions

On hover:

Text color changes

Bottom border color updates

The sliding background animation plays smoothly

These transitions give the card a polished, dynamic feel.
